# QA
You can ask me anything here, and maybe I will answer the questions or forward it into the communities to discuss. Also you can initiate a discussion here.

你可以在这里问我任何问题，我可能会回答你或将问题转发到社区讨论。另外你也可以在这里发起一个讨论。

## Why

I am maintaining a few communities with thousands of members, it’s too busy for me to answer these questions with direct message, at the meanwhile some may be common problems, I hope there are places to archive and summarize the discussion.

因为我同时维护了几千人的社区，实在忙不过来挨个回答大家私信我的问题，而且有些可能是共性问题，我希望有地方能够归档和总结。
